## Description
Linkey is a Zero-Knowledge platform to securely share a password or secret with end-to-end encryption.

This tool allows you to encrypt/decrypt using RSA public and private keys.

Because Linkey is a Zero-Knowledge platform, won't store any data.

Adventages:
- End-To-End encryption and decryption.
- Use of the RSA cryptosystem.
- No need complex infraestructure, is only html, js and css.

Disadvantages:
- Is not a One Time link, but is secure, so you can reuse only with the appropiate RSA keys.

## Features

These are the features that you will find in this app:

- Generate RSA Public and Private Keys.
- Encryp/Decrypt passwords and secrets with RSA cryptosystem.
- Generate Useful links to Share Passwords and Secrets.
- Send emails with the generated link with mailto.

## Install

Because Linkey is pure html, JS and CSS (Tailwind 😶‍🌫️) you can download or clone with git and open in your browser with just double click in the file ☺️

## How to Use it

To share (Encrypt):
Put the password/secret in the box, uploads the RSA public key and click on generate link, then copy and share it or just send the link by email.

To discover (Decrypt):
Just click the link, and uploads the RSA private key, and click on discover.

(Keep the link if you want to see the key again 😉)
